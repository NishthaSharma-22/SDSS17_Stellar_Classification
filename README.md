# SDSS17_Stellar_Classification
Classification of Stars, Galaxies and Quasars using Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR17 Dataset. <br>
This project focuses on classifying cosmic objects using the SDSS17 dataset. The aim is to distinguish between stars, galaxies, and quasars through machine learning techniques.

## Models Implemented
Two different models were utilized for classification:

- **Logistic Regression**: Achieved an accuracy of **93%**.
- **Decision Tree**: Outperformed the previous model with an accuracy of **97%**.
